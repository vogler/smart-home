# Caddy docs: https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile

# Problem is that many web apps don't work when put into a subpath:
# https://caddy.community/t/the-subfolder-problem-or-why-cant-i-reverse-proxy-my-app-into-a-subfolder/8575
# -> Easiest to make a subdomain for each app (see Caddyfile), but then we need to take care of DNS.

# Reverse proxy with subpaths:
# We need `redir /foo /foo/` instead of `rewrite /foo /foo/` for links to have the correct base!
# We need `handle_path` instead of just a matcher to strip the matched path prefix from the request!

# snippet for common case: import sub $path $port
(sub) {
	redir /{args.0} /{args.0}/
	handle_path /{args.0}/* {
		reverse_proxy :{args.1}
	}
}

# only use http for now, host without port means https
:80 {
	# working
	import sub news 8080
	# working
	import sub swm 8081
	# empty page, loads /*.{js,css} - need to set BASE_PATH: https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf/issues/845
	import sub chronograf 8888
	# redirects to /login - need to set subpath: https://grafana.com/tutorials/run-grafana-behind-a-proxy/
	import sub grafana 3000
	# working with correct headers: https://community.octoprint.org/t/reverse-proxy-configuration-examples/1107
	redir /octoprint /octoprint/
	handle_path /octoprint/* {
		reverse_proxy :5000 {
			header_up X-Scheme {scheme}
			header_up X-Script-Name /octoprint
		}
	}
	# working, used in octoprint
	import sub webcam 8090
	# redirects to /web, but can set base URL: https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/caddy.html
	import sub jellyfin 8096
}
