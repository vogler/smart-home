    # By default `docker compose up` creates a network service_default for each service which leads to 'Gateway Timeout' for `curl service.localhost` since the network is not shared with traefik.
    # Making all services use the existing bridge network works, however, this breaks name resolution between services in one stack, e.g. paperless can't connect to its 'broker' service anymore.
    # network_mode: bridge
    # Instead, we let compose create the network 'traefik_default' here and use it as an external network in each service...
